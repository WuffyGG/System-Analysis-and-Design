# System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for this project is DriverPass, represented by the business owner Liam and his IT officer Ian. DriverPass wanted a web based driving training system that supports both online learning and 
  on the road training. This system wold include user management, scheduling, reporting and communication systems while being secure and flexible on any device. This system would have customers, staff and     
  admininstrative functions wit data protection.

What did you do particularly well?
  I did a strong job creating uml diagrams representing the different use cases and functions of this system. This allowed me to showcase
  how the system works in a way where anyone could understand it with an explanation with each diagram.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the documentation. There are areas where I can most likely add more detail to make the information more specific and accurate to
  the companies needs.I would go more in detail on ways to improve security or on the functional or nonfunctional requirements so it can be even
  better for the company to use.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the users needs and implemented them into my system design through my uml diagrams. The uml diagrams showcased what 
  the user's needs in functionality and design for the user with role based access or users being able to login. It is important to consider the 
  user's needs when designing since this project should be satisfying the user and not your own personal needs.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I approach desinging software through gathering requirements and using descriptions and diagrams to organize that information. Using diagrams, mockups and 
  note taking allows for the user needs to be satisfied. Techniques or strategies I wouild use in the future to analyze and design a system would be more diagrams 
  and use case writings. Making sure use cases are desinged and communicated can allow the user needs to be satisfied.
